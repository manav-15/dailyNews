# LLMWiki Bootstrapping Instruction Manual for AI Agents

You are an AI coding assistant helping the user bootstrap a new personal knowledge base in this empty repository. Please follow these steps to initialize the LLMWiki:

## 1. Add the Engine Submodule
You must place the engine repository at `https://github.com/ajeygore/llmwiki.git` inside a folder named `llmwiki/` at the root of the user's workspace.
- If the current workspace is a Git repository, add it as a submodule:
  ```bash
  git submodule add https://github.com/ajeygore/llmwiki.git llmwiki
  ```
- If it is not a Git repository, clone it:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ajeygore/llmwiki.git llmwiki
  ```

## 2. Run the Setup Script
Run the bootstrapping script to copy the entry template, agent manuals, and page skeletons from the engine to the workspace root:
- **On macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  ./llmwiki/setup.sh
  ```
- **On Windows:**
  ```cmd
  llmwiki\setup.bat
  ```

## 3. Verify Layout
Confirm that the root directory now contains:
- `index.html` (the viewer dashboard template)
- `agents.md` (the instruction manual for agents)
- `README.md` (the quickstart guide)
- `wiki/` (the folder containing `welcome.md`, `index.md`, etc.)
- `raw/` (the folder for raw source inputs)

## 4. Instruct the User (Important)
Once setup is complete, output a clear message containing:
1. **Commit Changes**: Warn the user that new files have been created in their workspace and they **MUST commit these changes** (`git add . && git commit -m "Initialize LLMWiki skeleton"`) to keep their git history clean.
2. **Start Server**: Instruct them to start the local viewer server:
   - On macOS/Linux: `./llmwiki/run`
   - On Windows: `llmwiki\run.bat`
3. **Agent Integration**: Tell them to open the wiki dashboard (typically on `http://localhost:8001`), locate the welcome page at `wiki/welcome.md`, copy the **AI Agent Setup Prompt**, and paste it into their coding agent chat to begin auto-populating the wiki!
